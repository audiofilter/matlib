 HSINCW2
 MATLAB m-file for sinc windowing method for FD filter design
 h = hsincw2(L,d,wp,win) designs an (L-1)th-order FIR
 filter to approximate a fractional delay of d samples,
 where 0 &lt;= d &lt; 1, wp is the passband of approximation and
 win is a length-L window function 
 (e.g., win = chebwin(L,ripple), with sidelope ripple in dB).
 Output: length-L filter coefficient vector h
 Function Calls: standard MATLAB functions and sinc.m
