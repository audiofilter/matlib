Purpose
    2D plot zoom/measurement tool.

Synopsis
    zoomtool(h)

Description
    zoomtool(h) re-displays axes pointed to by the axes handle, h, with

        o Two horizontal and vertical cursor pairs.
        o A buttonbar with cursor control icons above the top axes.
        o A buttonbar with zoom control icons down the right axes.
        o Cursor location readouts along the bottom axes with addi-
          tional readouts for the difference (delta) between the 
          cursors.
        o A toggle button.
        o A quit button.

    These controls allow the user to

        o Measure a particular point on a curve.
        o Measure the X and Y difference between two points on a
          curve.
        o Independently zoom in on the curve between the vertical
        cursors.

    The cursor push button controls (one set for each cursor) allow 
    movement of the vertical cursor along the horizontal axis. The 
    horizontal cursor is automatically adjusted to the magnitude of 
    the corresponding sample at the vertical cursor location. The 
    push button controls are:

        o "<" and ">" move the vertical cursor to the next left or 
        right sample.

        o "<<" and ">>" move the vertical cursor to the next left or 
        right peak.

    Note:	A peak is defined a the next maxima or minima in the 
    curve formed by the vector values.

    In addition to cursor manipulation with push buttons, the 
    cursors can also be manipulated with the mouse. A single click 
    on a curve will move the nearest cursor (horizontal distance) 
    to that point. The mouse button can also be held down and the 
    nearest cursor "dragged" to the desired location.
    
    The zoom push button controls (one set for the X-axis, Y-axis, 
    and both X- and Y-axis) are:
    
        o "> <" zooms in on the X-axis between the cursors. Zooms to 
          maximize the view of the Y-axis.
        o "< >" zooms out to the previous zoom limits.
        o "[ ]" zooms out to the full axis limits.

    The X-Axis readouts are edit boxes. Using these edit boxes, a 
    desired location for the vertical cursors can be entered. 
    After pressing return, the cursor will be moved to the new 
    location. The "Delta X" readout is also an edit box. It can be 
    used to enter an offset from cursor 1 to place cursor 2. Enter- 
    ing a location such that a cursor would be located beyond the 
    limits of the axes will move the cursor to the axes limit.
    
    The toggle push button ("T") toggles the attachment of the 
    cursor to next curve when an axes contains more than one curve. 
    Toggling to a specific curve can be accomplished with the mouse 
    by simply selecting the desire line.
    
    If the handle, h, is omitted, the current axis is used.
    
    Quitting zoomtool with the quit push button ("Q") leaves the 
    axes in the last zoomed state, removing the button bars and 
    readouts. after which the user can print or otherwise treat the 
    axes as any other axes.
    
    Note:	Only one zoomtool can be active in a single figure 
    window at a time. Multiple zoomtools can be active as long as 
    they are attached to axes in different figure windows. While 
    active, zoomtool will cover the X-axis label and may also 
    cover the axes title.
    
Examples

Use zoomtool as an oscilloscope to measure the period of a 100 
Hz sinusoid.

    fs = 1000;	% sampling frequency
    ind = 0:1/fs:0.1;	% time index
    y = sin(2 * pi * 100 .* ind);	% generate sinusoid
    plot(ind,y);	% plot sine wave
    zoomtool(gca);	% start zoomtool

    o Use the cursor controls to move the cursor to the maxima of 
    two successive waveforms and read the period from the Delta X 
    readout.

Use zoomtool to measure the null-to-null bandwidth of a band 
pass filter.

    [b,a] = cheby2(10,5,[.4 .5]);	% design filter
    [h,w] = freqz(b,a,512);	% compute transfer function
    mag = 20*log10(abs(h));	% compute magnitude
    w = w/pi;	% convert to scale digital frequencies
    plot(w,mag);	% plot transfer function
    zoomtool(gca)	% start zoomtool

    o Use the cursor controls to move the cursors to either side of 
    the passband and read the bandwidth from the Delta X readout.

Use zoomtool to find the index of the impulse function 
resulting from the correlation of gaussian white noise.

    s = randn(256,1) * 2;	% a "noise" signal
    t1 = randn(1024,1);	% a noise source
    t2 = randn(1024,1);	% a second noise source
    t1(1:256) = t1(1:256) + s;		% add signal to first noise
    t2(201:200+256) = t2(201:200+256) + s;	% offset signal into second noise
    t1t2xx = xcorr(t1,t2);		% compute cross-correlation
    plot(t1t2xx)	% plot the cross-correlation
    zoomtool	% start zoomtool

    o Use the edit box to position cursor 1 at sample 1024 
    (identically zero in the cross-correlation). Grab cursor 2 and 
    drag it into close proximity to the impulse. Use the cursor 2 
    peak ("<<" or ">>") to place the cursor exactly on the impulse. 
    The index of the impulse can be read from the cursor 2 X-axis 
    readout. Note the Delta X readout displays the offset of the 
    "signal."
