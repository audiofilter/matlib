 ZOOMTOOL Axes zoom/measurement tool.
       ZOOMTOOL(H) activates the ZOOMTOOL on the axes
       specified by the handle H.

       ZOOMTOOL activates the ZOOMTOOL on the current axes.

       Once activated, ZOOMTOOL redraws the axis with two
       vertical/horizontal cursors and several controls.

       The cursor push button controls (one set for each cursor)
       allow movement of the vertical cursor along the hori-
       zontal axis. The horizontal cursor is automatically
       adjusted to the magnitude of the corresponding sample
       at the vertical cursor location. The push button
       controls are:

           &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; move the vertical cursor to the next
               left or right sample.

           &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; move the vertical cursor to the next
               left or right peak.

       A peak is defined a the next maxima or minima in the
       curve formed by the vector values.

       In addition to cursor manipulation with push buttons,
       the cursors can also be manipulated with the mouse. A
       single click on a curve will move the nearest cursor
       (horizontal distance) to that point. The mouse button
       can also be held down and the nearest cursor &quot;dragged&quot;
       to the desired location.

       The zoom push button controls (one set for the X-axis,
       Y-axis, and both X- and Y-axis) are:

           &quot;&gt; &lt;&quot; zooms in on the X-axis between the cursors.
               Zooms to maximize the view of the Y-axis.

           &quot;&lt; &gt;&quot; zooms out to the previous zoom limits.

           &quot;[ ]&quot; zooms out to the full axis limits.

       The X-Axis readouts are edit boxes. Using these edit
       boxes, a desired location for the vertical cursors can
       be entered. After pressing return, the cursor will be
       moved to the new location. The &quot;Delta X&quot; readout is
       also an edit box. It can be used to enter an offset
       from cursor 1 to place cursor 2. Entering a location
       such that a cursor would be located beyond the limits
       of the axes will move the cursor to the axes limit.

       The toggle push button (&quot;T&quot;) toggles the attachment of
       the cursor to next curve when an axes contains more than
       one curve. Toggling to a specific curve can be accom-
       plished with the mouse by simply selecting the desire
       line.

       If the handle, h, is omitted, the current axis is used.

       Quitting ZOOMTOOL with the quit push button (&quot;Q&quot;) leaves
       the axes in the last zoomed state, removing the button
       bars and readouts. after which the user can print or
       otherwise treat the axes as any other axes.

       Note: Only one ZOOMTOOL can be active in a single
       figure window at a time. Multiple ZOOMTOOLs can be active
       as long as they are attached to axes in different figure
       windows. While active, ZOOMTOOL will cover the X-axis
       label and may also cover the axes title.
