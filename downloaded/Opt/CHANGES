*Initial Entry: 3/13/2000*
Made changes to accomodate the case bug in the PC/Windoze version -
While in UNIX class names are completely case sensitive and are based
on the @ClassName directory, in the Windoze version they are case
insensitive when created and compared with isa(), but are internally 
always stored as lowercase.  So if the class directory (and intended
class name) is @ClassName, then the internal class name (as returned by
class()) will be classname, and classes that inherit ClassName will
have a field classname.  So we always have to lowercase references
to class names and child fields in Windoze.  In UNIX things work
as they should.  Code changes made:
  added OP_DATA.casebug field, ==1 for computer='PCWIN'
  whenever inherited fields (i.e. seq.optVector) are named directly,
    we need an if-then-else block to selectively lowercase the field
  changed "switch class(foo)" to "switch lower(class(foo))"
